# af-magic-dynamic
This is a copy of the af-magic theme, but with a dynamically-resizing prompt based on a minimum amount of whitespace which can be set by the user. The prompt changes  by collapsing the prompt either by using the shrink-path plugin or by truncating
it to only show the last segments (this can also be set by the user). See comments for details.
